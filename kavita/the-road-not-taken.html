        <div class="info">The Road Not Taken is a classic English poem written by the poet Robert Frost.</div>
        <div class="info">Written in 1915</div>

        <div class="first">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</div>
        <div class="first">And sorry I could not travel both</div>
        <div class="first">And be one traveler, long I stood</div>
        <div class="first">And looked down one as far as I could</div>
        <div class="first">To where it bent in the undergrowth;</div>
        <div class="first">Then took the other, as just as fair,</div>
        <div class="first">And having perhaps the better claim,</div>
        <div class="first">Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</div>
        <div class="first">Though as for that the passing there</div>
        <div class="first">Had worn them really about the same,</div>
        <div class="first"></div>
        <div class="first">And both that morning equally lay</div>
        <div class="first">In leaves no step had trodden black.</div>
        <div class="first">Oh, I kept the first for another day!</div>
        <div class="first">Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</div>
        <div class="first">I doubted if I should ever come back.</div>
        <div class="first"></div>
        <div class="first">I shall be telling this with a sigh</div>
        <div class="first">Somewhere ages and ages hence:</div>
        <div class="first">Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”</div>
        <div class="first">I took the one less traveled by,</div>
        <div class="first">And that has made all the difference.</div>
